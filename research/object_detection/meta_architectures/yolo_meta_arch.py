    parameters into a class and write config protos for postprocessing

    Args:
      is_training: A boolean indicating whether the training version of the+++
      anchor_generator: an anchor_generator.AnchorGenerator object.
      box_predictor: a box_predictor.BoxPredictor object.
      box_coder: a box_coder.BoxCoder object.
      feature_extractor: a YOLOFeatureExtractor object.
      matcher: a matcher.Matcher object.
      region_similarity_calculator: a
        region_similarity_calculator.RegionSimilarityCalculator object.
      image_resizer_fn: a callable for image resizing.  This callable always
        takes a rank-3 image tensor (corresponding to a single image) and
        returns a rank-3 image tensor, possibly with new spatial dimensions.
        See builders/image_resizer_builder.py.
      non_max_suppression_fn: batch_multiclass_non_max_suppression
        callable that takes `boxes`, `scores` and optional `clip_window`
        inputs (with all other inputs already set) and returns a dictionary
        hold tensors with keys: `detection_boxes`, `detection_scores`,
        `detection_classes` and `num_detections`. See `post_processing.
        batch_multiclass_non_max_suppression` for the type and shape of these
        tensors.
      score_conversion_fn: callable elementwise nonlinearity (that takes tensors
        as inputs and returns tensors).  This is usually used to convert logits
        to probabilities.
      classification_loss: an object_detection.core.losses.Loss object.
      localization_loss: a object_detection.core.losses.Loss object.
      classification_loss_weight: float
      localization_loss_weight: float
      normalize_loss_by_num_matches: boolean
      hard_example_miner: a losses.HardExampleMiner object (can be None)
      add_summaries: boolean (default: True) controlling whether summary ops
        should be added to tensorflow graph.
